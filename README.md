# ArtBuffet
is a third party ArtStation gallery UI mainly aiming to solve its major performance problems when using its infinite scrolling interface

You can see latest version in action at: https://artbuffet.nixes.cc

# Project Goal
To have a much more pleasant infinite scroll experience, but with a similar high density layout to the original website

# Road Map
- [x] Store current scroll progress so a user can come back to a page and resume from mostly the same place
- [x] Make code more general and create a simplistic api to allow other galleries to be plugged in easily
